        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
          The website was intended to present the project to possible partners
          that could benefit from it. That's why the main focus of the project
          was to display the most important aspects of the product in a visually
          appealing way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was given the content of the website (text and structure) and needed
          to create a design with the communications manager at the company. The
          website was implemented by a freelance front-end developer. The vector
          graphics were made by the company's graphic designer after I briefed him
          on what will be needed for the website.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="designProblem">
        <h1>Design problem</h1>
        <p>
          The most important issue was grabbing attention. The texts I was given
          presented the product well, but bullet points and descriptions are not
          easy when scanning a website — that's why we needed to come up with
          visual ways of presenting the ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the problems I noticed after I started working at QED was the
          inconsistent presentation of the company's portfolio. I wanted to change
          that. We discussed the problem with the communications manager and later
          I came up with some general visual guidelines that the website would take
          after other products.

      <section id="visualConcepts" class="multiple-flex">
        <h1>Visual concepts</h1>
        <p>
          Esensei is a product aimed at gamers, so one of the main themes should
          be gaming. At the same time it's an AI product and the company wanted
          to emphasise the tech behind it, therefore, we wanted to give the site
          a tech theme. The last element was the Sensei — it was part of the
          teaching metaphor and was crucial to the project brand, so the motif
          had to be used.
        </p>

        <p>
          I came up with a couple basic layouts for the website. Now when I see
          them, I have no idea how I thought somebody would pick the first ones,
          so I included only two (the winner included). I chose a subtle
          font (Barlow) to be easy on the eye, but not to overshadow the main
          visual components. For the colors I decided to go for something vibrant,
          gamers often love RGB lights, so I thought I would play with this idea.
        </p>

        <p>
          I planned an illustration for the second design in the style of another

      <section id="biggestDecision">
        <h1>Design decisions and brief</h1>
        <p>
          Along with the communications manager we decided to go with the last
          design. We went through all the diagrams and ilustrations needed –
          I suggested how they could look and later, after another discussion,
          we gave the graphic designer a brief with some direction. Here is
          an example of the designs used in the brief.
        </p>

        <h1>Visual consistency</h1>
        <p>
          QED Software employs many teams working on different project, but the
          website these projects produce don't look like they are from the same
          company. That's why I took some design solutions from other websites
          the company created. One of such decision was the slide structure taken
          from one project that's also a product for gaming.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="finalDesign" class="multiple-flex">
        <h1>Final design</h1>
        <p>
          I designed the website with the communications manager, but had to
          wait for the final illustrations for a long time. That's where the
          illustrations used in the brief came in handy; I could already design
          everything on a grid and later replace the illustrations with the final
          ones.
        </p>

        <p>
          The illustrations (although time-consuming) really made the website
          complete. They diluted the text-heavy presentation and gave a game-related
          but also hi-tech feeling.
