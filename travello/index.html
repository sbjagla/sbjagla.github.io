        A trip-planning tool for groups - Travello
        </header>
        <p>Travello is a solution to major problems that arise when planning
          trips in larger groups. Communication, keeping track of proposals and
          choosing best options become difficult in groups larger than three
          people. Even with three or four people planning the trip, keeping up
          with everybodyâ€™s opinion on proposals from different stages of the
          trip can be tricky. </p>

      <section>
        <h1>Design problem</h1>
        <p>At first, I thought about a fairly general solution for keeping track
          of proposals in any situation, such as looking for an apartment,
          choosing a new pair of trousers or travelling. However, such a
          solution needs to be quicker than a spreadsheet, it needs to add onto
          the experience of manually adding data into cells. That is why I
          decided it should be specialised for trips. This would narrow the
          scope of sites and services used to travel-centric and automatic data
          extraction from a link would be possible (because the developer would
          have time to really adjust the service to a couple of services).</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Competitive analysis</h1>
        <p>I looked for any solutions that would involve any form of
          organisation in travel. I searched through different search engines,
          but also looked for articles that point out the best methods for
          planning a trip.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found that there are no services that strictly meet the criteria for
          a group to work together on creating a trip plan. There are solutions
          for keeping track of booked hotels, flights and car rentals, but these
          help in organising what had already been booked. Only Mobili, an app,
          came close with their ability to share itineraries with a specified
          group.

      <section>
        <h1>Needs finding study</h1>
        <p>
          I conducted a semi-structured interview with 5 people recruited from
          my friends. At this stage I focused on deciding whether what I saw as
          a problem was really other people viewed as a challenge and whether
          they had already found other solutions for such problems. I
          interviewed 5 people with different characteristics in regard to their
          travel habits.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learnt that participants are largely satisfied with their current
          solutions to plan trips in groups. However, there are situations in
          which communication tools are not enough such as choosing dates that
          fit everyoneâ€™s schedule and possible flights or other transportation.
          Additional problems include counting costs, keeping track of money
          due, deciding in a disengaged group, voting on proposals and checking
          compatibility between dates and hours of subsequent stages. Even
          though these are problems that the users see, adapting a new tool for
          a large group has a high barrier of entry, which means it is not
          likely.
