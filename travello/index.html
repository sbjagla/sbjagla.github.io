          <p>A solution to major problems that arise when planning
            trips in larger groups. Communication, keeping track of proposals and
            choosing best options become difficult in groups larger than three
            people. Even with three or four people planning the trip, keeping up
            with everybody’s opinion on proposals from different stages of the
            trip can be tricky.</p>
          <p>
            You can find the full report <a href="../files/final-report.pdf">
            here</a> and the design <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/eRyv92rtXedkfvhK0OueVk/Final-design-Travello?node-id=0%3A1">
            here</a>.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="summary">
        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
          This will be a summary (this) of a summary (this webpage) of a report
          (<a href="../files/final-report.pdf">right here</a>), so I will keep
          it short.
        </p>
        <p>
          I followed a somewhat repetitive process to improve on the design. First,
          I conducted a semi-structured interview as a needs assessment study
          and synthesised the information with affinity notes.
          Then, I created some personas, some scenarios and some sketches. After
          that, I wrote down the design goals and got to work on wireframes,
          which later became a lo-fi prototype. I tested the prototype with two
          participants and came up with the key findings. Then, I created a
          mid-fi prototype and conducted a heuristic evaulation. After that was
          done, I tested the prototype on 5 people and implemented the key
          findings.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="designProblem">
        <h1>Design problem</h1>
        <p>At first, I thought about a fairly general solution for keeping track
          of proposals in any situation, such as looking for an apartment,
          choosing a new pair of trousers or travelling. However, such a
          solution needs to be quicker than a spreadsheet, it needs to add onto
          the experience of manually adding data into cells. That is why I
          decided it should be specialised for trips. This would narrow the
          scope of sites and services used to travel-centric and automatic data
          extraction from a link would be possible (because the developer would
          have time to really adjust the service to a couple of services).</p>
      </section>

      <section id="analysis">
        <h1>Competitive analysis</h1>
        <p>I looked for any solutions that would involve any form of
          organisation in travel. I searched through different search engines,
          but also looked for articles that point out the best methods for
          planning a trip.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found that there are no services that strictly meet the criteria for
          a group to work together on creating a trip plan. There are solutions
          for keeping track of booked hotels, flights and car rentals, but these
          help in organising what had already been booked. Only Mobili, an app,
          came close with their ability to share itineraries with a specified
          group.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="needsStudy">
        <h1>Needs finding study</h1>
        <p>
          I conducted a semi-structured interview with 5 people recruited from
          my friends. At this stage I focused on deciding whether what I saw as
          a problem was really other people viewed as a challenge and whether
          they had already found other solutions for such problems. I
          interviewed 5 people with different characteristics in regard to their
          travel habits. After that, I used affinity notes to get out the most
          important infromation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learnt that participants are largely satisfied with their current
          solutions to plan trips in groups. However, there are situations in
          which communication tools are not enough such as choosing dates that
          fit everyone’s schedule and possible flights or other transportation.
          Additional problems include counting costs, keeping track of money
          due, deciding in a disengaged group, voting on proposals and checking
          compatibility between dates and hours of subsequent stages. Even
          though these are problems that the users see, adapting a new tool for
          a large group has a high barrier of entry, which means it is not
          likely.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="sketches" class="multiple-flex two-images">
        <h1>Sketches, personas and scenarios</h1>
        <p>
          Using the needs identified in the needs finding study and the
          opportunities that came up in the competitive analysis, I drew 20
          sketches, created 3 personas and 3 scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sketches were supposed to be heavily exploratory, because there
          were many points of the design that could have been prioritised - like
          costs or fitting time constraints.
        </p>
        <div class="multiple-image">

            <img src="../images/sketch1.jpg" alt="A sketch with three columns.
            Every column contains proposals for stages of the trip. Proposals are

            named "Plan B" and "Plan A". There are elements such as 'hotel' in

            under it.">

        </div>
        <p>
          The personas I created were heavily based on the participants I
          interviewed during the needs assessment study. I decided this would
          be the safest approach because the participants represented the
          intended user base well and I would not introduced much bias.
        </p>
        <figure class="single-image" id="persona">
          <img src="../images/persona.png" alt="An image of a woman with three
          sections: demographics, motivators and limitations. All information

        </figure>
        <p>
          The scenarios were written (also drawn, but they don't deserve an online life)
          and closely tied to the personas and outlined the situations in which
          Travello should be useful. I used the scenarios in creating the design
          goals to outline any rough edges of the design (for example the
          tidiousness of going back and forth between the browser and Travello).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="lofi">
        <h1>Lo-Fi prototype and micro-usability test</h1>
        <p>Taking into consideration the design goals that emerged from previous
        steps I decided on a web app based on login links (no need for an
        account).
        </p>
        <p>I used Figma to create an interactive set of wireframes. I chose a
          layout and went a little bit out of the range of lo-fi wireframes to
          be certain that my wireframes can communicate the intention during
          the micro-usability test.
        </p>
        <figure class="single-image">
          <img src="../images/wireframe.PNG" alt="">
          <figcaption>
            Wireframe of the main menu for Travello (either as a web app or
            local app).
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The micro-usability test was conducted with the help of two female
          participants both 21 years old with more than two trips planned in the
          year of the interview. I presented the prototype on my phone with the
          Figma Mirror app which allows presenting an interactive prototype. I
          recorded the test with another phone and interviewed the participants
          briefly afterwards. The goal of this test was to see if the
          information architecture and general working of the service is easily
          understood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the test went generally well, there were many aspects of the
          prototype that were not clear to the participants - most importantly
          the trip-stage-proposal (at this time proposals were called 'options').
          I focused on the key findings from this test when creating the mid-fi
          prototype.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="midfi" class="multiple-flex">
        <h1>Mid-Fi prototype and heuristic evaluation</h1>
        <p>
          The main design goals for the prototype were clarity and low barrier
          of entry. This follows from the micro-usability test, where the
          architecture was not easily understood, and needs assessment study,
          where the participants admitted that groups are not willing to change.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also focused on improving the design in the areas it
          did not do well in the micro-usability test and on making it
          simplistic as well as usable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key tasks of the new prototype included:
          <ul class="list">
            <li>editting trips and adding new ones,</li>
            <li>voting on proposals and adding them simply through outside
              links,</li>
            <li>sharing trips via links,</li>
            <li>opening Travello as a chatbot in other apps,</li>
            <li>creating a simple spreadsheet for manual data.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          I evaluated the design afterwards using <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">
          10 usability heuristics by Jakob Nielsen</a>. The main issues that came
          up during the evalution were:
          <ul class="list">
            <li>lack of system status on some screens (Violation of
              "Visibility of system status"),</li>
            <li>no redo or undo buttons (violation of "User control and
              freedom"),</li>
            <li>no help and documentation (violation of "Help and
              documentation") - although this would come later in the design.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <aside>
          <p>
            During the designing process I followed the
            <a href="https://elementary.io/es/docs/human-interface-guidelines#human-interface-guidelines">
              "Human Interface Guidelines"</a> produced by the elementary OS team
              as well as other sources. I mention this as I am very thankful
              for the practical advice in the guidelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the mid-fi and hi-fi prototype I used icons by
            <a href="https://fontawesome.com/cheatsheet">Font Awesome</a>.
          </p>
        </aside>


      </section>

      <section id="hifi">
        <h1>Hi-Fi prototype</h1>
        <p>The hi-fi prototype was not far from the one used in the final users
          test. The design did well in the System Usability Scale questionaire
          (it received a score of 78, where 68 is a standard) and most of the
          participants had problems with the task descriptions or because the
          prototype did not anticipate their actions (even though the design
          was inteded to do so, so the final product would do fine).</p>
        <p>
          The main differences were making windows and buttons more consistent
          and giving the option buttons less priority by getting rid of their
          background. This way options do not dominate the rest of the screen.

        <h1>What I learnt from my mistakes</h1>
        <p>Now the most improtant part. This was my first full-fledged project
        in UXD, which means I had a lot to learn from my mistakes. These are the
        most important of them:
        <ul class="list">
          <li>I should have included accessibility as one of the design goals
          and when creating personas as well as scenarios. I read much more
          about including universal design in the process and now regret I did
          not do so,</li>
          <li>making the prototype in Figma is hard as there is no keyboard
          input possible. To make the prototype more natural, one should
          make participants click on text areas to enter pre-set text,</li>
          <li>timing and scheduling the design process is hard and much more
          time should be given for specific processes (such as implementing
          findings from heuristic analysis before user testing).</li>
