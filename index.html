        <p>I am a student who plans on working in human-computer interaction
        and user experience design. I love technology and making it more intuitive and
        accessible to humans grinds my wheels.</p>

          I live in Warsaw and study cognitive science at the University of Warsaw.

          <h2>Travello</h2>
          <p>I created Travello as my first full-fledged UXD project. I conducted
          a competitive analysis, a needs finding study through semi-structured interviews,
          a micro-usability test and later a usual usability test on a prototype created in Figma.</p>

          <p>I learnt HTML and CSS to understand how my designs will be implemented
          and as a first step in creating more believable prototypes.</p>

          <p>I study cognitive science, however, I am fascinated by human-computer interaction.
          I'm also a firm believer in social change and would like to leave the world having
          made it at least a little bit better. That's why I'm learning different ways on how
          to contribute to Linux and plan on working in accessbility.</p>
          <p>I also love talking about accessbility in software and life in general.
          Talking about biology and ecology is dear to my heart. The same goes for preserving
          this planet of ours.</p>
