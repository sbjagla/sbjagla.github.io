            One-page website for a small beauty salon that offers depilation
            and endermology. It's mainly directed at women, but anybody can use
            their services.
          </p>
          <p>
            See the website <a href="https://depilacja-laserowa-poznan.pl/">here</a>.

        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="summary">
        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
          The project was focused around two biggest pain points of the old design:
          information architecture (IA) and UI design. The IA needed a revamp to
          reflect that the salon is focused on two procedures. The visual side had
          to change to give an inviting, refreshing but also elegant impression.
        </p>
        <p>
          After going through all the information on the previous website I proposed
          an IA and three different visual concepts – the client chose the one they
          preferred. I designed the website according to the concept and later
          wrote the website in vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="designProblem">
        <h1>Design problem</h1>
        <p>
          The biggest problems for the previous website were clarity, visual
          integrity and not being mobile-friendly. I would include a picture, but
          I'm not mean enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          The layout and information architecture were convoluted with unclear
          names, duplicated information, seemingly random promotional images and
          no visual hints towards the service the website is supposed to promote.
          Moreover, the website did not have a mobile version.
        </p>
        <p>
          I talked with the client about the problems they saw with their website.
          The main issue was that <b> the website needed a general update</b>, so I focused
          heavily on the visual side of the project.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="informationArchitecture">
        <h1>Information architecture</h1>
        <p>The previous website consisted of:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>landing page with some prices and contact info,</li>
          <li>'About us' page,</li>
          <li>page on depilation with prices,</li>
          <li>prices page,</li>
          <li>contact info page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So the pricing table was repeated 3 times in different configurations,
          one procedure got much more attention than the other and there were three
          different places for contact info and text about the salon.
        </p>
        <p>
          I must admit that the one-pager idea came to me immediately and I just
          stuck with it, but I still believe there wasn't enough important info to merit
          a subpage. For tables and longer text I went for expandable
          titles. I did that first because of scrollability and second because I
          expect some people will want to read the descriptions, the FAQs and
          precautions, while others will be good with a short sentence on what, when,
          where and for how much.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to information itself, I decided to go with a segmented
          price table for both procedures and then two separate sections with
          the same stucture:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>quick description,</li>
          <li>icons presenting the time one visit takes, the frequency for the
          best result,</li>
          <li>FAQ,</li>
          <li>contraindications and precautions,</li>
          <li>more info about the procedure.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="visualConcepts" class="multiple-flex">
        <h1>Visual concepts</h1>
        <p>
          The website needed to give a general impression related to cosmetics
          and the beauty industry, but this could be taken into different directions.
          The first one for me was "spa". The website would be relaxing the same
          way the beauty salon is (anyone who experienced laser depilation will
          realise why this idea didn't take off). The second idea was heavily
          influenced by my talks with the client – they showed me other websites
          they liked, I took elements that could be promising and made something
          new. The third direction was focused around the effects of the procedures:
          clean and vivid skin, feeling of freshness and youthfullness. That's why
          I went with a picture of some perfectly fine legs.
        </p>
        <div class="multiple-image">
          <figure>
            <img src="files/first-concept.png" alt="">
            <figcaption>First direction: calming and fresh.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure>
            <img src="files/second-concept.png" alt="">
            <figcaption>Second direction: visuals liked by the client.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure>
            <img src="files/third-concept.png" alt="">
            <figcaption>Third direction: vivid and fresh feelings.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          We talked about the designs and chose the third direction, but I still
          wanted to incorporate the visual elements that the client liked. We
          also talked about the various menu options – we settled on the third
          option.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="biggestDecision">
        <h1>Most important decisions</h1>
        <p>
          There were some decisions I should mention here. <b>First is the logo</b>.
          I decided against doing anything with it. The logo was there and it was
          already on the sign above the salon's doors and on marketing material.
          Changing it just to change it or fit the font used on the website would
          only cause incosistency or (if we were to change all the materials) a
          huge financial burden.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <b>second decision was the menu</b>: personally I felt that a side menu fit
          the style the client showed me, but also gave an opportunity for the
          logo to be closer to the center of the action (it's a small venue in an
          increasingly competitive industry, so brand recognition is important).
          My only regret is not implementing an indicator for the current section.
          This would increase the feeling of responsiveness, but I did not have
          the time to learn JS enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <b>third decision was to not include any interactive map</b> on the website.
          This decision was easy for me, but the opposite's become the standard,
          so I will explain myself. Firstly, I would not do it well by myself and
          didn't want to risk it. Secondly, such plugins often break the style
          of the website. Thirdly, the salon is in a smaller city, so the streets
          are rather known to people who live there (although I admit some outsider
          might be left out). The last reason is privacy: the obvious choice would
          be Google, but those guys aren't really known for respecting data, so
          I wasn't going to sell the users' data only for the map.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="finalDesign" class="multiple-flex">
        <h1>Final design</h1>
        <p>
          After the visual concepts and taking some decisions, I designed the rest
          of the website. I had to edit the picture to give the purple a more
          mild look, make some icons (and take some from Font Awesome). Later I
          wrote the HTML and CSS, but stumbled upon a problem with the burger menu
          for mobile, so I used Javascript. Here are the final results.
