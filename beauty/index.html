            One-page website for a small beauty salon that offers depilation
            and endermology. It's mainly directed at women, but anybody can use
            their services.
          </p>
          <p>

      <section class="summary">
        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
          The project was focused around two biggest pain points of the old design:
          information architecture (IA) and UI design. The IA needed a revamp to
          reflect that the salon is focused on two procedures. The visual side had
          to change to give an inviting, refreshing but also elegant impression.
        </p>
        <p>
          After going through all the information on the previous website I proposed
          an IA and three different visual concepts – the client chose the one they
          preferred. I designed the website according to the concept and later
          wrote the website in vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="designProblem">
        <h1>Design problem</h1>
        <p></p>
      </section>

      <section id="informationArchitecture">
        <h1>Information architecture</h1>
        <p>The previous website consisted of a landing page, two subpages for information
          on each procedure offered, a subpage for prices and a <!-- TODO:jakie tam były zakładki??  -->.
          Even there were two separate price tables in the procedure pages and
          the main price table included all offers without segmenting them. I would
          include a picture, but I'm not mean enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          I must admit that the one-pager idea came to me immediately and I just
          stuck with it, but I still believe there wasn't enough important info to merit
          a subpage. For tables and longer text I went for expandable
          titles. I did that first because of scrollability and second because I
          expect some people will want to read the descriptions, the FAQs and
          precautions, while others will be good with a short sentence on what, when,
          where and for how much.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to information itself, I decided to go with a segmented
          price table for both procedures and then two separate sections with
          the same stucture:
          <ul class="list">
            <li>quick description,</li>
            <li>icons presenting the time one visit takes, the frequency for the
            best result,</li>
            <li>FAQ,</li>
            <li>contraindications and precautions,</li>
            <li>more info about the procedure.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="visualConcepts" class="multiple-flex">
        <h1>Visual concepts</h1>
        <p>
          The website needed to give a general impression related to cosmetics
          and the beauty industry, but this could be taken into different directions.
          The first one for me was "spa". The website would be relaxing the same
          way the beauty salon is (anyone who experienced laser depilation will
          realise why this idea didn't take off). The second idea was heavily
          influenced by my talks with the client – they showed me other websites
          they liked, I took elements that could be promising and made something
          new. The third direction was focused around the effects of the procedures:
          clean and vivid skin, feeling of freshness and youthfullness. That's why
          I went with a picture of some perfectly fine legs.
        </p>
        <div class="multiple-image">
          <figure>
            <img src="files/first-concept.png" alt="">
            <figcaption>First direction: calming and fresh.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure>
            <img src="files/second-concept.png" alt="">
            <figcaption>Second direction: visuals liked by the client.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure>
            <img src="files/third-concept.png" alt="">
            <figcaption>Third direction: vivid and fresh feelings.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          We talked about the designs and chose the third direction, but I still
          wanted to incorporate the visual elements that the client liked. We
          also talked about the various menu options – we settled on the third
          option.
